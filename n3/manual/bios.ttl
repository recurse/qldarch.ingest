In 1958, he obtained a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Queensland, after which he works for Conrad and Gargett for a couple of months before setting sail to England in 1959, together with his wife Sylvia Pearl Bennett. In London, Graham Bligh worked in the office of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, where he was involved in the design of the Pilkington Head Office. In 1960, he returns to Australia and becomes a partner of Bligh, Jessup Bretnall and Partners – an architecture firm set up by his father in 1926 in Toowoomba – where he worked until his retirement from architecture practice in 1999.
